# Spaceshooter

This is the first game I've built, here is the controls for it:

| action | key        |
| ------ | ---------- |
| move   | `up arrow` |
| shoot  | `space`    |

The game rules are easy, kill the ufo to get 100 score, get the highest score you can get, remember that you'll lose if time or bullets run out, you can get 2 bullets and 2 seconds if you kill a ufo, killing it will spawn it in another (random) place.

There is 3 numbers in the right up corner of the game screen, they represents:

| nth number | meaning       |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| #1         | time left     |
| #2         | bullets left  |
| #3         | current score |

Old version:
before I did this game , I did `https://learningphaser.5alidshammout.repl.co/` using phaser, I wanted to learn PIXI.JS so I did an improved completed PIXI.JS version which is this.
